We use a model-mapping approach to represent instances of {XML} and {XML} Schema in {RDF.} This representation retains the node order, in contrast with the usual structure-mapping approach. The processor can be fed with an unlimited set of {XML} schemas and/or {RDFS/OWL} ontologies. The queries are resolved taking in consideration the structural and semantic connections descrived in the schemas and ontologies. Such behaviour, schema-awareness and semantic integration, can be useful for exploiting schema and ontology hierarchies in {XPath} queries.},

Subsequently it introduces an extension of the {CIDOC} {CRM} ontology, able to capture the modeling and the query requirements
regarding the provenance of digital objects. Over this extension the paper provides a number of indicative examples of modeling
provenance in various domains. Subsequently, it introduces a number of indicative provenance query templates, and finally
it describes an implementation using Semantic Web technologies.},

	abstract = {{XML} has evolved to the format of choice for exposing data over the Web. Together with mature and maturing standards for querying {XML} ({XSLT}, {XPath}, and {XQuery)} the basic infrastructure for integrating multiple heterogeneous data sources is there. However, the versatility of {XML} as a data model and the unrestricted expressive power of {XML} query languages can lead to rather complex integration architectures, where low level syntactic heterogeneities and semantic heterogeneities are overcome all at once by means of complex query expressions. This paper explores how the Web Ontology Language {OWL} can be used as a more abstract modelling layer on top of {XML} data sources, described by an {XML} Schema, to which extent the semantic relationships provided by {OWL} can be used for mapping heterogeneous data sources to a common global schema, and how the inference mechanisms of {OWL} can be used to check the consistency of such mappings. Moreover, it introduces a query language for {OWL} as a natural extension of {XQuery}, and describes how these queries against a global schema are translated to {XQueries} against the original data sources.},

	note = {The {CIDOC} {CRM} is the most sophisticated, best documented and well-known ontology in the Cultural Heritage domain. So much so, that it is frequently referred to as a ‘miracle cure’ and ‘the only show in town’. Yet despite this perception, the rate of its adoption – like that of the Semantic Web with which it is frequently associated – has been glacial at best and almost exclusively by large, well-funded projects. What is hindering uptake and are there important lessons to be learned from it?
In their 1999 paper {‘Formality} Considered Harmful’, Shipman and Marshall identify four barriers to user interaction with formal knowledge systems: (1) The cognitive overhead required to understand the formalism, (2) The need to elicit tacit knowledge, (3) enforcing premature structure on unstructured or poorly-understood source material, (4) the problems caused by situational structure, i.e. the different needs of different users. While they note that there is no ‘silver bullet’ that addresses all of these challenges they do propose several palliatives that can assist, and therefore encourage, the transition from free to structured information where beneficial.
This paper will discuss these principals in reference to current doctoral research being undertaken in archaeological data integration. While the work in question has elected to use ontologies other than the {CIDOC} {CRM}, the results derived are also likely to be of interest to the {CRM} community. In particular it focuses on means by which microproviders – owners of the small but important datasets that form the ‘long tail’ of excavation data – can participate in semantics-driven datasharing.},

	note = {{CIDOC-CRM} is a new standard for encoding a wide range of information for Cultural Heritage ({CH).} At present, existing {CH} collections are stored using all sorts of formats, sometimes proprietary, often defined roughly, which 
makes it difficult to share or access heterogeneous information among the {CH} community. There is a need for a tool to map diverse formats into {CIDOC-CRM}, assisted by another tool using intelligent language technology to help 
the mapping whenever fields are underspecified or loosely described, both tools being complementary. In some cases, it may even be better to build fragments of a {CIDOC} database directly from informal descriptions in natural 
language only, as the {CH} community may be reluctant to switch to new formats of data entry. Therefore, this paper focus primarily on the mapping of {CH} data described in natural language into {CIDOC-CRM} triples, the building blocks of the full {CIDOC-CRM} ontology. The methods exploits the propositional nature of {CIDOC-CRM} triples. Using {WordNet} as a lexical database and the {WEB} as corpus, we first extract triples from examples provided in the {CIDOC-CRM} literature, and then from text describing the medieval city of Wolfenbüttel. We show the strong points of the system and suggest where and how it could be improved. Although the triples extracted automatically from texts do not provide a full picture of the {CIDOC-CRM} structure buried in the textual description, our results indicate that it provides a sound initial working basis for the mapping/translation process, saving time on what would otherwise have to be done by hand.},

Current argumentation models are either not analytical enough or restricted to formal logic. For that purpose, we seek a model of human argumentation in which reasoning may not only consist of falsification or verification but more generally of strengthening or weakening hypotheses, and a way to connect this model to an ontology of the domain of discourse. We have studied examples of factual argumentation in empirical research in archaeology. Based on this and other empirical material, we propose an innovative integrated model of factual argumentation that includes evolution, composition, and revision of arguments. It makes explicit both the processes of argument-making and the states of belief at a particular point in time in a composite inference, and connects explicitly to a domain ontology, free of tacit background knowledge. We have implemented the model in a more restricted form and tested it with published archaeological examples. Future work may generalize the model to other kinds of argumentation.},

	abstract = {{XML} is becoming the standard for data interchange on the Web. However, {XML} and its schema languages do not express semantics but rather structure, such as nesting information. Therefore, semantically equivalent documents often present different document structures. We provide an ontology-based framework that aims to make two {XML} documents intemperate at the semantic level while retaining their nesting structure. In our global-as-view approach, we generate an {RDF} ontology for each of the participating {XML} documents, which preserves the nesting structure of the document. An {RDF} global ontology is the result of merging the individual ontologies. The global ontology unifies the query access and establishes semantic connections among the underlying individual databases. We consider two types of queries: those that are posed on the global ontology and those that are posed on any of the {XML} documents, in a {P2P} fashion. The former type is processed using query translation from an {RDF} query to an {XML} query. The latter type entails bidirectional query processing: the translation from an {XML} query to an {RDF} query followed by the translation from an {RDF} query to an {XML} query. To ensure the correctness of the answer to the query in the latter case, we introduce the concept of reversibility of the query translation.},
